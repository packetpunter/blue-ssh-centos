# Dockerized SSH server in CentOS 7
## Intro
This container is built using my other [docker base image](https://github.com/packetpunter/blue-centos-base), so it will have to be built into your docker image list before this image can run.

## Basic Usage
Execute ./build.sh then ./run.sh. This assumes you have id_rsa.pub stored in the current directory.
